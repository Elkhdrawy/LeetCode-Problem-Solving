## 🗂️ Problem List

| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | Topics |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 217 | [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | [C++](./contains_duplicate.cpp) | Easy | `Array`, `Hash Table`, `Sorting` |
| 242 | [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | [C++](./Valid_Anagram.cpp) | Easy | `String`, `Hash Table`, `Sorting` |

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Navigate** to the problem folder (e.g., `217-contains-duplicate`).
2. **Open** the C++ solution file.
3. Each solution is self-contained and ready to be copied into the LeetCode editor.

## 🧠 Approach

My strategy for solving these problems focuses on:
- **Time Complexity:** Prioritizing optimal algorithms (O(n) or O(log n) when possible).
- **Space Complexity:** Minimizing memory usage without sacrificing readability.
- **Readability:** Writing clean, well-commented code that explains the logic.

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
- **Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## 📝 Notes

- Solutions are organized by problem number for easy reference.
- Each solution includes necessary headers and is formatted for LeetCode.
- I strive to provide the most efficient approach first.
