## 🛠️ How to Use  

1. Navigate to the problem folder (e.g., `217-contains-duplicate`).  
2. Open the C++ solution file.  
3. Copy & paste the solution into the **LeetCode editor**.  

Each solution is self-contained and ready to run.

## 🧠 Approach  

My problem-solving strategy focuses on:  
- **Time Complexity** → Prioritizing optimal algorithms (`O(n)` or `O(log n)` when possible).  
- **Space Complexity** → Minimizing memory usage without sacrificing readability.  
- **Readability** → Writing clean, well-commented code that explains the logic.

## 🔧 Technologies  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub  
- **Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## 📝 Notes  

- Solutions are organized by **problem number** for easy reference.  
- Each solution includes necessary headers and is formatted for LeetCode.  
- I strive to provide the **most efficient approach first**.
