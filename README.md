## üìä Daily Progress Tracker  

I log my daily solved problems in this **Google Sheet**:  
üëâ [Problem-Solving Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PDbQkgkrDcgx7EzNyjkfTMTszW7btHwH_0j0ApWJ4o/edit?gid=0#gid=0)  

This sheet contains:  
- Problem ID & Title  
- Solution Links  
- Difficulty Level  
- Main Topics

## üóÇÔ∏è Problem List (Sample)  

| #   | Title | Solution | Difficulty | Topics |
|-----|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| 217 | [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | [C++ Solution](https://github.com/Elkhdrawy/LeetCode-Problem-Solving/blob/main/contains_duplicate.cpp) | Easy | Array, Hash Table, Sorting |
| 242 | [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | [C++ Solution](https://github.com/Elkhdrawy/LeetCode-Problem-Solving/blob/main/Valid_Anagram.cpp) | Easy | String, Hash Table, Sorting |

‚û°Ô∏è Full problem list is available in the [Tracker Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PDbQkgkrDcgx7EzNyjkfTMTszW7btHwH_0j0ApWJ4o/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

1. Navigate to the problem folder (or open the solution link directly from the table).  
2. Copy & paste the solution into the **LeetCode editor**.  

Each solution is self-contained and ready to run.

## üß† Approach  

My problem-solving strategy focuses on:  
- **Time Complexity** ‚Üí Prioritizing optimal algorithms (`O(n)` or `O(log n)` when possible).  
- **Space Complexity** ‚Üí Minimizing memory usage without sacrificing readability.  
- **Readability** ‚Üí Writing clean, well-commented code that explains the logic.

## üîß Technologies  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub  
- **Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## üìù Notes  

- Solutions are organized by **problem number** for easy reference.  
- Each solution includes necessary headers and is formatted for LeetCode.  
- I strive to provide the **most efficient approach first**.
