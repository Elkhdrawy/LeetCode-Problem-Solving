## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

1. Navigate to the problem folder (or open the solution link directly from the table).  
2. Copy & paste the solution into the **LeetCode editor**.  

Each solution is self-contained and ready to run.  

---

## üß† Approach  

My problem-solving strategy focuses on:  
- **Time Complexity** ‚Üí Prioritizing optimal algorithms (`O(n)` or `O(log n)` when possible).  
- **Space Complexity** ‚Üí Minimizing memory usage without sacrificing readability.  
- **Readability** ‚Üí Writing clean, well-commented code that explains the logic.  

---

## üîß Technologies  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub  
- **Environment:** Visual Studio Code  

---

## üìù Notes  

- Solutions are organized by **problem number** for easy reference.  
- Each solution includes necessary headers and is formatted for LeetCode.  
- I strive to provide the **most efficient approach first**.
